## Gemini Added Memories
- This project orchestrates the 'twenty' CRM, PostgreSQL, Redis, 'fundraising-service', and Nginx gateway using Docker Compose.
- It is the central orchestration point for the AI-first non-profit CRM solution, which also involves the 'twenty-core' and 'fundraising-service' projects.
- When discussing how to build new features, always consult the DECISIONS.md file first to ensure the proposed approach aligns with established architectural principles.
- For this project, I should constantly consider whether the current approach is the best one and challenge it or suggest alternatives if I believe it can be done better, especially for foundational architectural decisions.
- Architectural decisions should be recorded in `DECISIONS.md` as an ADR. This includes new decisions and updating existing ones if they are reconsidered.
