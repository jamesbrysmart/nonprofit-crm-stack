## Gemini Added Memories
- This project orchestrates the 'twenty' CRM, PostgreSQL, Redis, 'fundraising-service', and Nginx gateway using Docker Compose.
- It is the central orchestration point for the AI-first non-profit CRM solution, which also involves the 'twenty-core' and 'fundraising-service' projects.
- When discussing how to build new features, always consult the DECISIONS.md file first to ensure the proposed approach aligns with established architectural principles.
- For this project, I should constantly consider whether the current approach is the best one and challenge it or suggest alternatives if I believe it can be done better, especially for foundational architectural decisions.
- Architectural decisions should be recorded in `DECISIONS.md` as an ADR. This includes new decisions and updating existing ones if they are reconsidered.
- **Debugging Learnings:** When host-based scripts (e.g., TypeORM migrations) connect to Docker services, ensure: 1. The service's port (e.g., 5432 for Postgres) is mapped to the host in `docker-compose.yml`. 2. The script's connection credentials (from `.env`) match the service's credentials in `docker-compose.yml`. 3. File generation paths in scripts (like `migration:generate`) match the paths where the tools expect to find them.
- **Authentication:** Twenty's APIs are authenticated using a long-lived API key, which must be sent as a bearer token in the `Authorization` header (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`). The `x-api-key` header is incorrect.
- **POC Status:** The POC task 'Create API endpoints for Gifts' (Issue #1 in `nonprofit-crm-fundraising-service`) is currently blocked. Refer to the issue for details on the blocker and the plan to revisit after Q3's 'import/export configurations' feature.
- **Project Structure:** This project uses Git submodules to manage the `fundraising-service` and `twenty-core` repositories. These submodules are located in the `services/` directory. Always ensure that the `docker-compose.yml` file and other configurations align with this structure. Refer to `DECISIONS.md` (D-0014) for more details.
