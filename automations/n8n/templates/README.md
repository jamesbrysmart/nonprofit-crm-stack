# n8n Templates

Store sanitized, reusable workflow exports here (no secrets).

Guidelines:
- Export from n8n as JSON and keep names descriptive.
- Prefer examples that call fundraising-service or Twenty APIs.
- Document any required env vars or headers in the workflow notes or a short companion README.
