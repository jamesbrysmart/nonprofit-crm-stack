# Apps (Provisional)

This folder hosts Twenty apps that extend the stack without modifying submodules.

Structure (current operating model):
- `apps/core/` for cross-module extensions (e.g., rollup-engine, enhanced households).
- `apps/fundraising/` for fundraising-owned extensions (e.g., Gift Aid, receipts).
- `apps/custom/` for one-off org-specific apps.

This layout is provisional until Twenty apps support richer UI/layouts and we can
bundle module apps for hosted distribution.
