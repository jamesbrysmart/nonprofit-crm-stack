# Gift Aid App (Draft)

Standalone Twenty app for UK Gift Aid workflows. This is a placeholder
scaffold so we can design the metadata and flows before implementation.

## Intent (provisional)
- Capture Gift Aid declarations linked to donors.
- Flag eligible gifts and link them to declarations.
- Export claim-ready batches.

## Next design steps
- Confirm metadata schema (GiftAidDeclaration object + Gift fields).
- Define enablement UX and admin defaults.
- Add serverless function entry points for declaration capture and export.
